## Other ways to run tests:
Running the tests locally in different **browsers** (they have to be installed):
```bash
testcafe chrome firstTest.js
testcafe edge firstTest.js
testcafe safari firstTest.js
testcafe firefox firstTest.js
```
Running the tests in **headless** mode:
Simply add **headless** after the browser name like in this example:
```bash
testcafe chrome:headless firstTest.js
```
Running **multiple tests** at the same time:
To run the tests in different windows we have to specify before the browser with `-c` parameter and the number of windows we want to, for example:
```bash
testcafe -c 3 chrome firstTest.js
```
We can also convine with headless like this:
```bash
testcafe -c 3 firefox:headless firstTest.js
```
Running **multiple browsers** at the same time:
You can run in multiple browsers at the same time by adding then together in the same line like this example:
- testcafe chrome,firefox firstTest.js

### Known Issues:
When running from local using `testcafe chrome testname.js` for example, sometimes an error related to scripts run can pop up, we can skip this error by using this command in the **terminal**:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
